# Super-Bash-Bros
A small game inspired by 'Super Smash Bros.' that I made for a group project in first year of university.

# How to play
Go to CodeSkulptor3 (https://py3.codeskulptor.org/) and paste in the code in the game.py file. Click run and start a game. Sometimes the instance will end due to the assets not loading, this should be solved by running the game a second time.

Alternatively, you can go directly to an instance of the game's code in codeskulptor through this link: https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user311_gkxzTw0LN1_59.py
